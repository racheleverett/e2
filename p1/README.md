## Game planning

- Adding a 3x3 multidimensional array
- All elements of array are empty
- Set 2 computer players
- Distribute cell value X, O to each player
- Each player can guess x, y values between 0, 2
- After a player makes a guess, check if that spot is empty
- If not then make another guess until a proper move has been made
- Loop through the moves until either all places are filled or a winning combination is made
- If win combination found, terminate
